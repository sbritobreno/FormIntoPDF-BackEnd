                  Where work takes place on roadway, all crews must ensure that
                  correct PPE (Class 3) is used to ensure you are visible to
                  other road users.<br /><br />
                  Crews must ensure that PPE, particularly hi visibility
                  clothing, is clean and that the reflective strips are present
                  and in order.<br /><br />
                  Where insufficient light is present, artificial lighting must
                  be used to permit the staff to work safely.<br /><br />
                  To ensure that the technical aspects of the work are
                  undertaken properly and where light is inadequate, the crew
                  will use the miner's lamps.<br /><br />
                  Where works take place on a footpath, barriers must be erected
                  such that the reflective strips are visible to pedestrians.
                  Appropriate retro-reflective signage must be erected. All
                  signage must be clean and all decals must be in good order.<br
                  /><br />
                  Crew must ensure that they do not erect barriers in a manner
                  that creates unsafe conditions for pedestrians such as guiding
                  them into potholes, depressions in grassed areas, badly broken
                  or unstable walkways etc.<br /><br />
                  Where temporary pedestrian walkways are to be placed on the
                  roadway the required signage as per Chapter & and any relevant
                  traffic management plans must be in place.<br /><br />
                  Crew must exercise caution when crossing roadways.<br /><br />
                  Where the crew judge the working conditions to be unsafe due
                  to lighting conditions, they must escalate the issue to their
                  agent for further advice.
