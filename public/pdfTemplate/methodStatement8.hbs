                  Suitable means of access will be provided to allow access to
                  heights. These may include scaffolds, stepladders, ladders,
                  mobile elevating work platforms (MEWP) or other items of
                  plant, but in the main will consist of ladders.<br /><br />
                  Barrels, drums or other unapproved items must not be used as a
                  step/platform.<br /><br />
                  Where ladders are to be used, they must be EN 131, in good
                  condition, set in place in a safe manner and inspected every
                  week on form GA3.<br /><br />
                  Ladders must extend a minimum of 1m above the parapet or flat
                  surface to be accessed i.e. ground level in relation to
                  excavations.<br /><br />
                  Where scaffolds or alloy towers are to be used, they must be
                  assembled by a competent person who holds the appropriate CSCS
                  ticket. The scaffold or tower must be inspected prior to first
                  use, and a handover certificate received from the person who
                  assembled it. No person may assemble an alloy tower or
                  scaffold unless they are in possession of an appropriate CSCS
                  ticket and are authorised by their manager to assemble said
                  piece of equipment.

                  Staff will be made aware of the dangers associated with the
                  works during the course of their on-site induction.<br /><br
                  />
                  The immediate area must be kept clear of all debris and trip
                  hazards.<br /><br />
                  Where excavations are underway and where operatives are
                  working in close proximity, only those staff who must be in
                  the vicinity may be so.<br /><br />
                  When access is not required for an extended period, more than
                  12 hours, the excavation must be covered over using Heras
                  fencing or other suitable material. The excavation must also
                  be protected using RNCE Ltd barriers immediately around the
                  excavation and an additional Heras rail fence to be placed at
                  the perimeter of the work area, a minimum of 1.5m from the
                  RNCE Ltd barriers.
